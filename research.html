  <h2>1. Genome-wide CRISPRi screening for antifungal resistance</h2>
  <p>
    We use genome-scale CRISPRi screens to perturb gene expression across the fungal genome
    and reveal genetic determinants of resistance, sensitivity, and tolerance under antifungal stress.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Identification of pathways required for antifungal survival</li>
    <li>Prioritization of genetic targets for mechanistic follow-up</li>
    <li>Quantitative sensitivity and resistance scoring from pooled screens</li>
  </ul>

    Genome-scale CRISPRi: pooled perturbation, selective growth, sequencing-based readout.

  <h2>2. Plant-derived antifungal discovery and quantitative phenotyping</h2>
  <p>
    We screen and fractionate plant extracts to identify small molecules with antifungal activity,
    then quantify growth inhibition and recovery dynamics under defined conditions.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Bioactivity-guided fractionation to identify active molecules</li>
    <li>Quantitative plate-based kinetics for inhibition and persistence</li>
    <li>Synergy testing with existing antifungal drugs</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="methods">
    Quantitative phenotyping: standardized inoculation, time-resolved growth dynamics,
    computational extraction of phenotypic parameters.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Mechanistic dissection using integrative multi-omics</h2>
  <p>
    We integrate CRISPRi screens with transcriptomics and proteomics to define mechanisms of antifungal response,
    validate targets, and reveal stress adaptive regulation.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>RNA-seq and proteomics for pathway-level phenotypic interpretation</li>
    <li>Candidate validation through targeted perturbation</li>
    <li>Mechanistic mapping of antifungal response networks</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="methods">
    Functional validation: CRISPRi knockdown, phenotypic assays, stress response profiling.
