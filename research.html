        <h2>Antifungal Drug Resistance</h2>
        <p>We investigate how pathogenic fungi evolve and acquire resistance to antifungal therapies, identifying genetic mutations and pathways that enable survival against treatments.</p>

        <h2>Stress Response Pathways</h2>
        <p>Our lab studies how fungal cells respond to stress (such as oxidative or osmotic stress), uncovering how these organisms adapt to hostile environments and host defenses.</p>

        <h2>Functional Genomics Screens</h2>
        <p>Using CRISPR/Cas9 and CRISPRi techniques, we perform genome-wide screens to identify genes involved in fungal drug resistance and pathogenicity, paving the way for novel antifungal targets.</p>
